# ðŸ”°Day 8: Accessing and Iterating through Tuples

Welcome to **Day 8** of the **30 Days of Coding** challenge! ðŸŽ‰ Today, we dive into **tuples**, an immutable data structure in Python, and explore 
how to work with them effectively using loops. Tuples are great for storing ordered collections of items that shouldn't change.

## ðŸ‘‰Task 1: Working with Tuples  

### Description:  
In this task, you will create and manipulate a tuple to explore its properties and usage.  

### Instructions: 
1. Create a tuple containing numbers from 1 to 10.<br>[You can use `range()` and `tuple()` for this]
2. Perform the following operations:  
   - Access the 3rd element using indexing.  
   - Slice the tuple to extract elements from index 4 to 8 (inclusive).  
   - Concatenate the first tuple with another tuple containing `(11, 12, 13)`.  
   - Check if `5` exists in the tuple using the `in` keyword.  
   - Find the length of the tuple using the `len()` function.  

### Examples:  
#### Expected Output:
    Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
    Third element: 3
    Sliced tuple (index 4 to 8): (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    Second Tuple: (11, 12, 13)
    Concatenated Tuple: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13)
    Does 5 exist in the tuple? Yes
    Length of the tuple: 13

## ðŸ‘‰Task 2: Using Loops with Tuples  

### Description:  
In this task, you will use both `for` and `while` loops to process and manipulate tuples.  

### Instructions:  
1. Create a tuple of numbers or strings.  
2. Perform the following operations using loops:  
   - Use a `for` loop to print all elements of the tuple.  
   - Use a `while` loop to print elements of the tuple in reverse order.  
   - Create a tuple of strings (e.g., `("apple", "banana", "cherry","Blueberry")`) and use a loop to print only the strings that start with the letter 'b'.  

### Examples:  
#### Expected Output:
    The tuple: (23, 54, 71, 13)
    All the elements in the tuple:
    23
    54
    71
    13

    All the elements in the tuple in reverse order:
    13
    71
    54
    23
    
    The tuple named Fruits: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'Blueberry')
    Fruits that starts with the letter "B":
    banana
    Blueberry

### -Summary-  
Day 8 focuses on mastering **tuples** and their integration with **loops** to manipulate and 
extract information effectively. Keep practicing to solidify your understanding of these versatile data structures. Happy coding! ðŸš€
