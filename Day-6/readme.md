# ðŸ”°Day 6: Working with Lists and Strings  

Welcome to **Day 6** of the **30 Days of Coding** challenge! ðŸŽ‰ Today, youâ€™ll practice using **lists** and **strings** in Python. Lists allow you to store multiple items in a single variable, while strings offer robust methods for text manipulation. These tasks will help you improve your problem-solving skills with Python data types.

## ðŸ‘‰Task 1: List Manipulation  

### Description:  
In this task, you will work with lists to perform operations such as appending, extending, and calculating properties of the list (sum, smallest, and largest values).

### Instructions:  
1. Create an empty list. Prompt the user to input 5 numbers one by one (using any loop) and store them in a list by using `.append()` method.  
2. Display the first list containing these 5 numbers.  
3. Assign a second list containing 4 or 5 numbers, into a variable. #(not by user input) 
4. Extend the first list by adding the second list to it using the `.extend()` method.  
5. Display the extended list.  
6. Calculate and display the sum, the smallest number, and the largest number from the extended list.  

### Examples:  
#### Input:
    Enter a number: 10  
    Enter a number: 25  
    Enter a number: 5  
    Enter a number: 15  
    Enter a number: 20 
#### Output:
    The first list of numbers is: [10.0, 25.0, 5.0, 15.0, 20.0]
    The extended list of numbers is: [10.0, 25.0, 5.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 35.0, 40.0, 45.0]  
    Sum of all numbers: 225.0  
    Smallest number: 5.0  
    Largest number: 45.0

## ðŸ‘‰Task 2: List Manipulation along with List methods()

### Description: 
In this task, you will work with a sentence provided by the user. The sentence will be split into words and manipulated using slicing and list methods().

### Instructions:  
1. Prompt the user to input a sentence.  
2. Split the sentence into a list of words.  
3. Display the following:  
   - The original list of words.  
   - The first three words.  
   - The last two words.
   - The list of words in reverse order.(this should be like in the example output)
   - The elements in this list in Ascending order.
   - The elements in this list in descending order.

### Examples:
#### Input:
    Enter a sentence: Python programming is fun and educational.
#### Output:
    Original list of words: ['Python', 'programming', 'is', 'fun', 'and', 'educational.']
    First three words: ['Python', 'programming', 'is']
    Last two words: ['and', 'educational.']
    Reversed list of words: ['educational.', 'and', 'fun', 'is', 'programming', 'Python']
    Reversed sentence: educational. and fun is programming Python
