# Day 3: Exploring Data Types and String Slicing  
Welcome to **Day 3** of the **30 Days of Coding** challenge! Today, we will focus on:  
1. Understanding and working with **data types**.  
2. Practicing **string slicing** operations.

## Task 1: Exploring Data Types  

### Objective:  
In this task, you will:  
- Collect user inputs for their name, age, and height.  
- Perform calculations and formatting to present the information.
- Use `type()` function to find data types.

### Instructions:  
1. Ask the user for their name, age, and height (in centimeters).  
2. Use string formatting to print a summary message that includes the inputs.  
3. Convert the height from centimeters to meters.
4. Display the `name`, `age`, `height`, and `converted height` with proper formatting.
5. Display the data types of `name`, `age`, and `converted height` with proper formatting.

### Example:
#### Input:
    What is your name? Robert  
    How old are you? 25  
    What is your height in centimeters? 165  
#### Expected Output:
    Hello, Robert!  
    You are 25 years old and 165.0 cm tall.  
    That is 1.65 meters tall. 
    Data Type of name: <class 'str'>
    Data Type of age: <class 'int'>
    Data Type of converted height: <class 'float'>

## Task 2: String Slicing Practice  

### Objective:  
Explore string slicing techniques to extract and manipulate parts of a string provided by the user.  

### Instructions:  
1. Ask the user to input a word or sentence.  
2. Perform the following string slicing operations:
   - Extract the first characters of the string.
   - Extract the first three characters of the string.
   - Extract the last characters of the string.
   - Extract the last three characters of the string.
   - Extract every second character in the string.  
   - Reverse the string.  
4. Print the results for each operation.

### Example:
#### Input:
    Enter a word or sentence: Python Programming  
#### Expected Output:
    First character: P
    First three characters: Pyt  
    Last character: g
    Last three characters: ing  
    Every second character: Pto rgamn  
    Reversed string: gnimmargorP nohtyP
