# ðŸ”°Day 9: String Analysis and Palindrome Check  

Welcome to **Day 9** of the **30 Days of Coding** challenge! ðŸŽ‰ Today, we will focus on analyzing strings and exploring the concept of **palindromes**. These tasks will strengthen your understanding of string operations and conditional logic in Python.

## ðŸ‘‰Task 1: Analyzing Vowels and Consonants in a Sentence  

### Description:  
In this task, you will analyze a sentence provided by the user to determine the number of vowels and consonants. This helps in understanding string iteration and character classification.  

### Instructions:  
1. Prompt the user to input a sentence.  
2. Count the number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) in the sentence.  
3. Count the number of consonants.  
4. Ignore spaces, numbers, and special characters during counting.  
5. Display the total number of vowels and consonants.

### Note: The following functions will be helpful to program this.
`string.isalpha()`,`string.lower()`,`string.upper()`<br>

### Examples:  
#### Input:
    Enter a sentence: Python is fun!
#### Output:
    Total number of vowels: 3
    Total number of consonants: 8

## ðŸ‘‰Task 2: Palindrome Check  

### Description:  
In this task, you will determine whether a given word is a **palindrome**â€”a word that reads the same backward as forward. This task emphasizes string slicing and case-insensitivity.  

### Instructions:  
1. Prompt the user to input a word.  
2. Check if the word is a palindrome by comparing the word with its reverse.  
3. Ignore case while checking.  
4. Display an appropriate message indicating whether the word is a palindrome.  

### Examples-1:  
#### Input:
    Enter a word: Madam
#### Output:
    The word 'Madam' is a palindrome.

### Examples-2:  
#### Input:
    Enter a word: Python
#### Output:
    The word 'Python' is not a palindrome.
