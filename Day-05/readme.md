# ðŸ”°Day 5: Looping in Python

Welcome to **Day 5** of the **30 Days of Coding** challenge! ðŸŽ‰ Today, we will focus on working with loops in Python. 
Loops are essential for executing repetitive tasks efficiently. In this session, youâ€™ll explore both `for` and `while` loops to solve real-world problems.

## ðŸ‘‰Task 1: Multiplication Table and String Iteration  

### Description:
In this task, you will use a `for` loop to:  
1. Generate and display a multiplication table upto 10 for a given number.  
2. Loop through a string provided by the user and print each character on a new line.

### Instructions:  
1. Prompt the user to enter a number for which they want the multiplication table.  
2. Use a `for` loop to display the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.  
3. Prompt the user to input a string.  
4. Use a `for` loop to iterate through the string and display each character on a new line.  

### Examples:
#### Input:
    Enter a number for the multiplication table: 5
    Enter a string: Python

#### Expected Output:
    Multiplication Table for 5:
    5 x 1 = 5
    5 x 2 = 10
    5 x 3 = 15
    5 x 4 = 20
    5 x 5 = 25
    5 x 6 = 30
    5 x 7 = 35
    5 x 8 = 40
    5 x 9 = 45
    5 x 10 = 50

    Characters in the string 'Python':
    P
    y
    t
    h
    o
    n

## ðŸ‘‰Task 2: Sum of Natural Numbers Using a `while` Loop  

### Description:  
In this task, you will use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of natural numbers up to a user-specified limit. Natural numbers are positive integers starting from 1.

### Instructions:
1. Prompt the user to input a positive integer as the limit.  
2. Use a `while` loop to calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to the specified number.  
3. Display the result to the user.  

### Examples: 
#### Input:
    Enter a positive integer: 5
#### Output:
    The sum of natural numbers from 1 to 5 is 15.

### -Summary-
Todayâ€™s tasks will help you strengthen your understanding of 
how to use loops in Python to handle repetitive operations effectively. 
Keep practicing, and donâ€™t forget to experiment with different inputs! ðŸš€
