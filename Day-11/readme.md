# Day 11: Exploring Sets and Tuples  

Welcome to **Day 11** of the **30 Days of Coding** challenge! ðŸŽ‰ Today, we explore **sets** and **tuples**â€”two fundamental data structures in Python. Sets are collections of unique items, while tuples are immutable sequences.

## Task: Set Operations 

### Description:  
In this task, you will perform various operations on sets to understand their unique properties.  

### Instructions : 
1. Create two sets of integers.  
2. Perform the following operations on the sets:  
   - Find the union of the two sets.  
   - Find the intersection of the two sets.  
   - Find the difference (elements in the first set but not in the second).  
   - Find the symmetric difference (elements in either of the sets but not in both).  
3. Display the results of each operation.  

### Examples:  
#### Expected Output:
    Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    Intersection: {3, 4}
    Difference: {1, 2}
    Symmetric Difference: {1, 2, 5, 6}
