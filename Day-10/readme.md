## ðŸ‘‰Task 1: Word and Character Count in a Sentence  

### Description  
Analyze a sentence provided by the user to determine the number of words and characters (excluding spaces). This task builds your understanding of string splitting and iteration.  

### Instructions  
1. Prompt the user to input a sentence.  
2. Count the total number of words in the sentence using the `split()` method.  
3. Count the total number of characters in the sentence, ignoring spaces.  
4. Display the total number of words and characters.  

### Examples  
#### Input:
    Enter a sentence: Python is amazing!
#### Expected Output:
    Total number of words: 3
    Total number of characters (excluding spaces): 15

## ðŸ‘‰Task 2: Rotating a List  

### Description  
Manipulate a list of integers by rotating it a specified number of steps to the right. This task emphasizes understanding list indexing and slicing.  

### Instructions  
1. Prompt the user to input a list of integers, separated by spaces.  
2. Ask the user to input a number `n` representing the number of steps to rotate.  
3. Rotate the list `n` steps to the right, ensuring the rotation works for any valid value of `n`.  
4. Display the rotated list.  

### Examples  
#### Input:
    Enter a list of numbers: 1 2 3 4 5
    Enter the number of steps to rotate: 2
#### Expected Output:
    Rotated list: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
